# Ducky.

It's a chat bot and it talks! This is an expansion on Ducky that incorporates interactions when it is asked questions. It still does not talk when you are just making statements. If you want to get feedback, make sure you have a question with a question mark in your message. This is mostly because it's annoying to type little messages as you think and have AI feedback in the middle of every thought.

Maybe if I get fancy in the future, I'll add NLP in order to better decide when to respond. But that's out of scope for now.
